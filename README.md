# Pizza Game
This is a game for making a pizza inspired by the game Pizza Mania. Pizza Mania is designed to teach basic math.

There are three different types of pizza toppings: pepperoni, mushrooms, olives and peppers. During the game toppings are randomly added or taken off of the pizza. To win you must have the correct number of pizza toppings on your pizza.
